# PWA Icons

This directory should contain two icon files for the Progressive Web App:

1. `icon-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
2. `icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

To generate these icons:

1. Use the existing `brain.svg` file as a base
2. Convert it to PNG format in two sizes:
   - 192x192 pixels for the smaller icon
   - 512x512 pixels for the larger icon
3. Place both PNG files in this directory

You can use any image editing tool to create these icons, such as:
- Adobe Illustrator
- Inkscape
- GIMP
- Online converters

Make sure the icons are:
- Square (equal width and height)
- PNG format
- Have transparent backgrounds
- Are clear and recognizable at both sizes
